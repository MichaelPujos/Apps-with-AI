## 🧠 AI Tools Used

### 📝 Claude AI
Used to generate emotionally powerful lyrics about immigrant labor and dreams. Example prompt:
> "Write a spoken-word poem about immigrants shaping America's future."

### 🎵 Suno AI
Used to turn Claude’s poem into a song using the "Spoken Word / Cinematic" style.
- [https://suno.ai](https://suno.ai)

### 🎨 DALL·E (via GPT-4)
Used to create all four images:
- Construction scene at sunset
- Diverse engineers in a tech office
- Immigrant family portrait
- A young woman climbing toward a futuristic skyline

### 💻 React
Built a fully functional web app to present the audio, images, and story with a clean, professional UI.
